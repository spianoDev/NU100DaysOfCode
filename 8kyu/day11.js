/** Directions **/

//It's too hot, and they can't even…
// One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy watermelons. They chose the biggest crate.
// They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide their loot, however they faced a hard problem.
//
// Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the number of watermelons
// in such a way that each of the two parts consists of an even number of watermelons. However, it is not
// obligatory that the parts are equal.
//
// Example: the boys can divide a stack of 8 watermelons into 2+6 melons, or 4+4 melons.
//
// The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them
// and find out, whether they can divide the fruits in the way they want.
// For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.
//
// Task
// Given an integral number of watermelons w (1 ≤ w ≤ 100; 1 ≤ w in Haskell), check whether Pete and Billy can divide
// the melons so that each of them gets an even amount.
//
// Examples
// divide(2) === false // 2 = 1 + 1
// divide(3) === false // 3 = 1 + 2
// divide(4) === true  // 4 = 2 + 2
// divide(5) === false // 5 = 2 + 3
// divide(6) === true  // 6 = 2 + 4

/** Function **/

function divide(weight){
    //first I will eliminate all odd numbers since those will never divide evenly.
    if (weight % 2 === 1) {
        console.log(weight / 2);
        return false;
    } else if (weight === 2) {
        //after some thought, I realized that only 2 cannot be divided into an even number
        console.log(false);
        return false;
    } else {
        // all other even numbers will always present that possibility if you subtract 2 from the original weight
        if (weight / 2 % 2 === 1) {
            console.log((weight - 2) / 2);
        } else {
            console.log(weight / 2);
        }
        return true;
    }
}

/** Advanced Solution (Refactored) **/

function divide(weight){
    return !(weight % 2 === 1 || weight === 2);
}

/** Test Cases **/

// divide(4); // => true
// divide(2); // => false
// divide(5); // => false
// divide(88); // => true
divide(100); // => true
divide(67); // => false
divide(90); // => true
