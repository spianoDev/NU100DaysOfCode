# NU100DaysOfCode:
A selection of challenges for our NU FSF cohort to encourage daily coding practice.

## Set Up Ideas
 
It will help if you get organized by setting up a template for each challenge. I prefer to make each day a challenge
 so I can easily track my progress, but you could also use the name of each challenge as the file name.
 
Inside each individual challenge, I use the same template:
 - link from CodeWars
 - kyu level
 - directions
 - code
 - test cases

## Submitting Solutions in CodeWars

Once you have a working solution, you will want to check it against the tests created for the challenge in [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/). Simply copy the code from your text editor into the 'Solution:' box. Here is a short video explaining that process: [How to Submit Solutions in CodeWars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDwg6-sUd3I)

## Knowing When to Stop

Sometimes when working through a challenge, you may hit a wall. The most important part of #100DaysOfCode is to gain daily practice working on solving coding problems. If you have reached a frustration point, take a break and come back to it. Often the answer is revealed a few hours later since your brain will keep working on the problem even when you step away from your computer! However, if you are completely stuck, or you have spent hours looking at the same three lines of code, it might be time to throw in the towel. 

I use this checklist as a guide:
 - [ ] Worked for more than 1 - 2 hours
 - [ ] Spent 15 minutes (or more) without adding any code
 - [ ] Failed more tests than previous attempts (meaning I'm getting further away from a solution)
 - [ ] Feelings of defeat, extreme frustration, or low self-esteem 
 - [ ] Several sessions without a complete solution
 
If you have to give up, try to get at least a few test cases working and document those successes. Remember, the more you practice, the easier this will get. Good luck and happy coding!
